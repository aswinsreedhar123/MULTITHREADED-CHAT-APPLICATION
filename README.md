Objective:
The primary objective of this program is to develop a client-server chat application using Java that supports communication between multiple clients via a central server. It leverages sockets for network communication and multithreading to handle multiple clients concurrently. This demonstrates fundamental networking concepts and multithreading in Java while enabling real-time interaction.

Features:Two Modes (Client and Server):The program provides a menu to choose between server mode (hosting the chat) and client mode (participating in the chat).

2. Multithreaded Server:The server handles multiple clients concurrently, ensuring smooth communication without blocking other clients.

3. Broadcast Messaging:Messages sent by one client are broadcast to all other connected clients via the server.
